# Modern (1989) 

The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 

He lets me lie down in green pastures. 

He leads me to still waters. 





# King James Bible (1611) 

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. 

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. 

He leadeth me beside the still waters. 





# Middle English (1100-1500) 

Our Lord gouerneth me, and nothyng shal defailen to me. 

In the sted of pastur he sett me ther. 

He norissed me upon water of fyllyng. 



# Old English (800-1066) 

Drihten me raet, ne byth me nanes godes wan.

 And he me geset on swythe good feohland. 

And fedde me be waetera stathum.
