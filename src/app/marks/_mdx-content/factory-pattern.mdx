# Factory Pattern

With the factory pattern we can use **factory functions** in order to create new objects. A function is a factory function when it returns a new object without the use of the `new` keyword!

Say that we need many users for our application. We can create new users with a `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email` property. The factory function adds a `fullName` property to the newly created object as well, which returns the `firstName` and the `lastName`.

```
const createUser = ({ firstName, lastName, email }) => ({
  firstName,
  lastName,
  email,
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
});
```

Perfect! We can now easily create multiple users by invoking the `createUser` function.
